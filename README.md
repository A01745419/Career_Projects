Here you can see my projects in many programming languages, but I will only show some pdf with screenshots of the results and short descriptions, this is because these are academic works, so avoiding plagiarism is critical. But if you would like to analize and try the codes, please let me know and I can give you the access to my private repository where you can find the files. 

High School

I included some of my first projects (their reports).
1. Python / soccer concept video game on PyGame.
2. Python / analysis of Twitter information with developer account.
3. Arduino / prototype of a strongbox with components.

Career

1st Semester

1. Python / data analysis of COVID Mexico files. (Individual).
2. Python / statistics and linear regression with basic machine learning for a food register file. (Individual).
3. C++ / basic algorithm for E-business based on Object-oriented programming. (With 1 friend).
4. MATLAB / simulation of events related to physics and mathematics, volcano launch and roller coaster trip. (Team). 

2nd Semester

QUANTUM HackMx: I included the presentation of my first Hackathon in a different folder, this was in April 2021 and my team and I won the first place. We took the NDS Cognitive Labs challenge, where we had to detect bank fraud with machine learning, besides we were the best project for NDS, we had an honorable mention from Wolfram.
1. MATLAB / edge detection algorithms on images. (Team).
2. MATLAB / simulation of electric fields of parallel plates. (Team).
3. R / biological analysis with dataset from GEO and bioinformatic resources. (Team).
4. MATLAB / simulation of electromagnetic fields of four figures and animation of particle trajectory in it. (Team).
5. C++ / basic algorithm for Streaming service based on Object-oriented programming. (With 1 friend).

3rd Semester

1. C++ / implementation of data structures to understand botnet presence in network accesses. (Team).
2. Assembler (MARIE Simulator) / program to store measurements in memory that takes as reference a sensor that delivers a reading.
3. Arduino / SQL / PHP / temperature_humidity and co2 sensor readings monitoring station for IoT. (With 1 friend).

4th Semester
1. Unity / SQL / Typescript / PHP / 2D videogame based on percussions that is connected by APIS to a database that leads to a data warehouse for decision making. (Team). |Training Partner: Percussive Arts Society|
2. Clojure / simulation of an assembler based on operations defined by opcodes. (With 1 friend)
3. Packet Tracer / network proposal for ICPC event based on subnetting and basic protocols. (Team) |Training Partner: Tec de Monterrey and Cisco|
